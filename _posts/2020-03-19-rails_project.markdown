I finally made it to the third project in the program and to say I was nervous is an understatement. I knew that this project was only gonna be harder then the last two. This was very challenging but also very rewarding at the same time. They covered a lot of material leading up to this and some of it was a little tough to wrap my brain around. I knew that once I started working on the project that it would start to make a little more sense.

I started the project out by figuring out what the requirements were and how I was going to be able to meet them. I knew that this would be a little more tricky then the last project. I came up with a plan on what i wanted to do and started to sketch it out. I knew I wanted to build something that would be pratical to use and maybe something I could even use in day to day life.  

I started by creating my models and database. I need to figure out what I wanted my tables to be and how to set them up. I also need to set up my has many and has many through relationships. Once I had all these things figured out and created then I could move on to really starting to build it up. One of the requirements was to have validations for the models. So I figured out what I need for wach one and created them.

Next I moved on to working on the controllers and views. I worked on those together cause they kinda go hand in hand. Your controllers have the code that you use to make your app work and the views is what the user sees as they interact with it. One thing I should of mentioned was I also had to figure what routes I was gonna use to be able to display the views correctly. I set them up, and tested the views to make sure everything was working properly. 

I knew I had a good amount left after i set those things up but it was a lot of fun to work on. I really enjoyed working through the errors and troubleshooting as I went a long. I am very thankful for the experiences that I have been having going through this program.
