I finally made it to the fourth project and honestly I was not looking forward to it. I have worked with Javascript in the past and we really aren't friends. I knew this time would be different and that I would be more positive going into it.  I started my planning and came up with a subject I was gonna work with, then dove in. The positive mindeset lasted about two days and all the bad feelings came rushing back to me reminding why I didn't like this language to begin with. I knew this was gonna be challenging, but maybe not as much as it was. It really tested me and kept me on my toes.

I started by creating the API on the backend using rails. I knew that I needed to follow rails MVC and RESTful conventions as I was building this out. I started by creating my database and setting up the attributes I would need for both models. I moved on to the models  and set them up.  I had to have one has many relationship with my models so I decided on what that was gonna be then I implimented it.  Then I figured out what controller actions I wanted to use for both my models and set them up. I started building out the basic logic for them, cause I knew I would have to go back and make changes to them.  I say this for the simple reason of when I start wroking on my AJAX calls on the frontend, that some of the methods will change a little bit to make sure everything works correctly. Once I had that where I wanted it, I moved onto the next part of the project.

The frontend of the project was a lot smaller file wise then the backend, which might be deceiving if you aren't familiar with building programs. I decided to make three files to use on the frontend an HTML, a CSS and a Javascript file. The JS file would be the biggest one out of the three and would be the most challenging one to plan out and then to build. I started with my HTML file and built out a basic skeleton to have to work with.
I dove head first into the JS knowing that I was gonna be tested and probably get very frustrated as I worked through it. I have to say you work through the lessons and learn the different ways to work with JS, but as soon as you try to use it you brain goes blank. Maybe that is just me.
I started using the debugger as I was building this project, all I have to say it is an awesome tool once you learn how to use it.

I learned a lot while working on this project and I feel like I still have a lot left to learn. I know that once I can wrap my mind around everything JavaScript has to offer that I will be able to build some really cool things. This is a powerful language that is used all the time and it really is amazing.
