The end of my time at Flatiron is coming to a close and it has been one heck of a ride. I started this journey over a year and it has been really challenging working through the course. I started this endeavor with a little bit of coding knowledge but now I have a whole new arsenal at my disposal. I have my final project review to go through and then I will finally be able to graduate. I am nervous but I am really excited for this new chapter that I am about to start. I never thought that I would be able to make it as far as I did, but I kept pushing through to make it to the finish line. I have to say that the support system that we have is awesome and everyone is so eager to help you succeed. It's a great community and I am really glad that I took the leap and jumped in.

When I first started the program I was excited to learn Ruby and get know what this language is capable of doing. It was a bit tricky at the start but as I worked my way through the lessons it started to get a little easier to understand. The thing I liked about Ruby is that when there is an error, it would let you know what is was and where it was in the code. It made debugging a little less nerve racking and a bit more manageable. I still struggled with debugging at times but i knew that I wouldn't spend hours trying to find it in my code. Google is also your friend when you run into issues, there was always an answer to any problem you ran into. Pry is another great tool to use for debugging also but that took me a little bit of sometime to get use to. Overall I think Ruby, Sinatra and Rails were probably my favorite languages to learn.

I remember when I started the course that I was dreading having to do JavaScript because I tried it once before but couldn't grasp it very well. Spoiler Alert I had just as much trouble this time through also. I ended up repeating this section a few times just to be albe to get a general understanding of what is going on with everythinng happening. I still have a ton to learn with JavaScript but at least I have a good enough understanding where I feel comfortable being about to write code and building a working program. I know that I will be continuing to work on JS after I graduate because that is such a powerful language and there are so many amazing things you can do with it.

React was the final challenge that I had to conquer to be able to cross the finish line and be able to graduate. It was tough to understand and I struggled working though but I know that I came out better then when I started. The possibilities with React are endless and it's a very powerful langauge that is widely used throughout the web. I would probably say that Redux was what I struggled with the most in the final section of the course. It was a little tough to wrap my head around but I generally understood most of the principles that it taught. I know I will definitely need to keep learning both React and Redux because there is so much more to these two then what they touch on in the curriculum. Once I have a good understanding of these two I know that my tool belt will be even better then it is already.

So I as I come to the end of this blog post, I am preparing for my final assessment and can't wait to see where my path leads me once i can finally say that I graduated.
