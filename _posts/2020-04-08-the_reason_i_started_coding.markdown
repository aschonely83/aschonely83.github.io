I have been working retail for most of my life and that is really all I knew.  I have been doing manual labor and it started taking it's toll on me. I have had three rotator cuff surgeries and unfortunately they were all on the same shoulder which isn't good for the kind of work I do. I knew that it was time to really think about what i was doing and what I could do to help maintain myself for the rest of my live. I have a family I need to take care of and provide for but the road I was heading down seemed like I didn't know how much I could physically take moving forward.


I decided to take a chance and start learning how to code to maybe one day make it a career. I started out by doing the normal way of finding free resources on the internet and learning that way. I struggled as I l worked through the curriculm. I enrolled in a course on a site I found and worked my way through as best as I could not really understanding a lot as I went through. The course was on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. I completed the course but JavaScript left a bad taste in my mouth after I finished. So I gave up on coding and didn't pursue it again for almost three months.


This time around I was determined to find a school online I could do but one I knew that would be good for me and have the support that I needed. I ended up looking up bootcamps and was suggested that I try FlatIron. I started with the free classes they offered and loved the way that it was done by TDD also known as Test Driven Development. It was something new to me and it caught me by surprise but in a good way. I ended up taking a closer look at the school and decided that I wanted more so I decided to pursue the Part Time Software Engineering program. I am really glad that I decided to do it.

This leads me to now where I am two modules away from being done and I love everything about it. It has been very challenging and I'm sure I missed some stuff along the way but that is ok because there is so much out there to help fill in the gaps. I have built three projects so far and they were a lot of fun to do. I learned about how to plan and troubleshoot diffrent aspects of a project to make it the best I could. I am excited for the rest of this trip and can't wait to be able to do this as a career when I graduate.
